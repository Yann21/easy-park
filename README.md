## Project Description
The goal of this project is to plan and organize a website that uses a few resources like fuel, time and space. This website will help people to achieve a faster, easier and denser parking of their vehicles of the majority of time they remain idle.
This project driven in a website meets the demands of citizens for the difficult problem of parking the car. A large number of vehicles in motion and restricted areas for use are some of the challenges faced by the commuters in the daily debate for a parking space. This website will user real-time data to enable the users to observe the unavailable and available parking locations. There are many benefits that this project will bring, such as:

1.	Optimized parking – the user will be able to find a parking spot by saving up on time, effort and resources 
2.	Reduction in Traffic – driving around to search a parking spot will be avoided 
3.	New Revenue streams – the parking price will depend from parking location 
4.	Decrease management costs – will bring more machine control meaning saving on resources more.

As a website yet to be developed into its full features, will be able to find a parking spot near the location that you are in. There will be two options to insert your location entering a zip code or use the current location using the geolocation function. After location has been given a list of available parking spots will be given to the user, on the website the user will be able to pay or reserve the parking spot for an amount of time. If the cancellation is needed, we will offer it one hour prior in order to get refund. Once the parking spot has been reserved or paid the feature of map view that shows the direction to the destination will be available. 

This project is based on the Incremental model which operates with the idea of developing an initial version and then changing this version to the final one.

## User Docs
We will provide a user manual document to get build instruction and other information on week 11.

## Final Presentation 
Will be uploaded on week 12 of the project
